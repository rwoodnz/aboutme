      <p>Wellington's Dev Academy is training people to be software developers with a 9-week intensive course licenced from San Francisco's Dev Bootcamp. The course is also preceded by weeks of part-time preparation so everyone is ready to hit the ground running on course. The group I'm with will be finished mid-July and ready-to-roll. The course covers either Rails or C# plus many other development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. An important aspect of the course is working in teams.</p>

      <p>InternetNZ is a charitable incorporated society that protects and promotes the Internet in New Zealand. The organisation receives most of its revenue through its subsidiary's management of the .nz domain space. As an elected Councillor I sit on the governance board of the organisation and am on the business development committee. Previously, as a staff member of InternetNZ I organised the first two NetHui Internet conferences in New Zealand.</p>

        <p>My homemade electric car project is on hold until at least after the Dev Academy course. It involves replacing the engine of a BMW 318ti with an electric motor and batteries. The target is a suitable commuter car that can handle the Wellington hills.</p>
